"""Demand Forecasting Callbacks - Complete Implementation

NOTE: The main forecast callbacks are implemented in pages/demand_projection.py
This file is kept for additional future forecast-related callbacks.
The forecast execution, progress tracking, and modal controls are all handled
in the demand_projection.py page itself for better organization.
